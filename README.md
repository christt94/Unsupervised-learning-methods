# Unsupervised-learning-methods
In this activity, you will apply various unsupervised learning methods—including k-means clustering, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and principal component analysis (PCA)—to a real dataset. 

The goal is to explore how these techniques can uncover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures without the need for labeled data.

By the end of this activity, you'll be able to:

Apply k-means and DBSCAN clustering: Implement k-means to partition data into a predefined number of clusters, and use DBSCAN to identify clusters and outliers based on density.

Perform dimensionality reduction with PCA: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, simplifying it while retaining most of the variance for visualization and analysis.

Visualize and interpret unsupervised learning results: Create scatterplots to visualize clusters formed by k-means and DBSCAN, and analyze how PCA transforms the data for easier interpretation of underlying patterns.
